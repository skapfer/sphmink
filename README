sphmink -- compute spherical Minkowski tensors W1

This is a simple program which computes the quadratic and cubic
invariants of the W1 spherical Minkowski Tensor.
It needs the GNU Scientific Library to compile (libgsl-dev or gsl-devel or
something similar, depending on your distribution).

Compiling:  Type 'make'

Invocation:  See compute_sphmink script.

The input file has the same specs as Karambola labelled input (.poly).
Some examples can be found in the ref_structures folder.

The output file will contain one line per label,
comprising the invariants in the order

    label q0 w0 q1 w1 q2 w2 ...

up to a limit which can be set in the source code (MAX_L).
You can find reference results for the bcc, fcc and hcp Voronoi cells
in the folder ref_structures.
