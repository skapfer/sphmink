sphmink -- compute spherical Minkowski tensors W1

This is a simple program which computes the quadratic and cubic
invariants of the W1 spherical Minkowski Tensor.
It needs the GNU Scientific Library to compile (libgsl-dev or gsl-devel or
something similar, depending on your distribution).

Compiling:  Type 'make'

Invocation:  See compute_sphmink script.

The input file has the same specs as Karambola labelled input (.poly).

The output file will contain one line per label,
comprising the invariants in the order

    label q0 w0 q1 w1 q2 w2 ...

up to a limit which can be set in the source code (MAX_L).
